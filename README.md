Schema Matcher and Combiner

This repository contains code for schema matching and combination using various techniques such as Levenshtein distance and TF-IDF vectorization. The notebooks provide implementations and examples of how to match and combine schemas from different datasets.
Notebooks
1. MatcherAndCombiner.ipynb

This notebook provides implementations for schema matching and combining using Levenshtein distance. It includes the following functionalities:

    Levenshtein Distance Calculation: Calculates the Levenshtein distance between strings.
    Schema Mapping using Levenshtein Distance: Maps columns between two schemas based on the Levenshtein distance of column names and sample values.

2. Task2.ipynb

This notebook includes additional tasks and functionalities related to schema matching and combination, potentially using different or enhanced techniques.
